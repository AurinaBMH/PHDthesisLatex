This thesis includes 2 original papers published in peer reviewed journals, 1 paper submitted for publication and 1 paper in preparation. The core theme of the thesis is the investigation of genetic markers of brain connectivity.

Fulcher. The inclusion of co-authors reflects the fact that the work came from active collaboration between researchers and acknowledges input into team-based research.
