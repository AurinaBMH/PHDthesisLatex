First and foremost, I am deeply grateful to my supervisors Prof. Alex Fornito and Dr. Ben Fulcher who provided me with invaluable scientific guidance and supported my academic development. I would like to thank you both for being extremely supportive, patient, and understanding, and for reminding me the importance of the `big picture' along the way -- it was a real pleasure working with you. I am also very grateful to Prof. Mark Bellgrove for the provided opportunities, words of encouragement and guidance.

I would like to sincerely thank my friends and colleagues, whom I have met during my PhD and shared this journey with. Especial thanks go to Philip Ward, Linden Parkes and Stuart Oldham for making me feel welcome on my first arrival to Australia and for the shared experiences and discussions through those years. I feel very lucky to have met Martina Arenella -- thank you for being the endless source of inspiration and positivity when I needed it the most. I am immensely grateful to Mana Biabani for the close bond that we share -- having such an understanding and supportive friend was the best gift anyone could ask for.

I am extremely thankful to my parents for supporting my decisions and embracing all hardships that came up over the course of my long time away. Finally, my warmest gratitude goes to my fianc\'{e} Armandas for making our Australian adventure possible -- thank you for your unconditional support, love and encouragement to take on new challenges.
